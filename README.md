# vntToTxt
A simple program that converts vNote files to plain text files

## To use

1. Launch the program using your method of choice.

2. Type or copy the directory containing the vNote files into the command prompt (There is no GUI currently).

3. Check in the `converted` directory inside the directory given for the txt file output.

There is very little error handling, and it is pretty unstable.
